# Hi, I'm David

You may remember me from such open source projects as [TinyIpc](https://github.com/steamcore/TinyIpc) and software like [Screamer Radio](https://www.screamer-radio.com/).

I am a full stack .NET developer that live in Stockholm, Sweden and have been working full time with .NET since 2007.
